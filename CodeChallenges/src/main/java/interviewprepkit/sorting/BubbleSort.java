 * Given an array of integers, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following three lines:
 *
 *  Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps., where  is the number of swaps that took place.
 *  First Element: firstElement, where  is the first element in the sorted array.
 *  Last Element: lastElement, where  is the last element in the sorted array.
 *  Hint: To complete this challenge, you must add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.
