 * The Fast Food Joint is a restaurant that offers fast food.
 * In order to be fast, we need to test different strategies to deliver food as fast as we can
 *
 * Current tests with:
 * - Single thread code synchronous code
 * - ForkJoin framework ( the code has blocks [ Thread.sleep ] so maybe not the best approach )
 * - Executor service
